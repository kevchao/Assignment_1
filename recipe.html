    <p>
        ½ cup/8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), melted 
    </p>
    <p>
        4 fat garlic cloves, grated 
    </p>
    <p>
        ½ cup Parmesan, grated 
    </p>
    <p>
        ¼  cup  firmly  packed  chopped  flat-leaf  parsley  
    </p>
    <p>
        ¼  teaspoon  kosher  salt 
    </p>
    <p>
        Black  pepper 
    </p>
    <p>
        1 baguette or rustic crusty loaf 
    </p>
    <p>
        ½ pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced (optional) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 1
    </p>
    <p>
        Heat the oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together the butter, garlic, Parmesan and parsley. Add 
        the salt and generously season with pepper. Set aside while you cut the baguette. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 2
    </p>
    <p>
        Cut deep slits  into  the  baguette,  1-inch  apart  —  don’t  cut  all  the  way  through  the  loaf  —  and  place  the 
        baguette  on  a  large  piece  of  foil.  Using  a  teaspoon  or  an  offset  spatula,  generously  spread  the 
        seasoned butter inside each slit. Make sure to reach the bottom of the slit; don’t be shy here. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 3
    </p>
    <p>
        Wrap  the  baguette  in  the  foil,  place  on  a  baking  sheet  and  bake  for  15  minutes.  Remove  the 
        baguette  from  the  oven  and  unwrap  the  top  (leave  the  bread  on  the  foil).  If  you’re  adding 
        mozzarella, use the offset spatula or spoon to gently open each slit and tuck a piece of mozzarella 
        in (it’s O.K. if the cheese pops out from the top a little). Return bread to the oven and bake until 
        crisp and golden on top, another 5 minutes. Slice with a serrated knife (or tear with your hands) 
        and serve at once.
